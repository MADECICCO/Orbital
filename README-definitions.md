**Predicting the Sun's RA and Dec**

We can use the Sun's motion around the ecliptic to calculate the right ascension (RA), and declination (dec) of the Sun on any given day. Around March 20th, the Sun is at the first point of Aries and has zero dec, and zero RA. Since it is moving from south to north at this point, the dec of the Sun will increase with time. The dec of the Sun reaches a maximum of +ε at the summer solstice, and a minimum of -ε at the winter solstice. What happens to the Sun's right ascension? Imagine the Sun at noon on the vernal equinox. The Sun is on the observer's meridian. One sidereal day later, all the stars are in the same position. However, since the sidereal day is shorter than the solar day, the Sun has not yet reached the meridian; it is slightly to the east. Since RA increases to the east, it follows that the Sun's RA has increased. Over the course of a year the Sun must move through 24h of RA to return to the same place, so the Sun's RA increases by roughly 2 hours a month. The applet below summarises the motion of the Sun in RA and dec, over the course of a year. 



**Spherical Co-ordinate Systems: Latitude and Longitude**

Co-ordinate systems, used to measure positions on a sphere will be very important in this course. As as introduction, here is a reminder about how we measure position on the surface of the Earth.

The rotation of the Earth provides a natural way of defining position. The rotation axis meets the Earth's surface at the North and South Poles. The great circle which is perpendicular to the rotation axis is the equator. Any point on the Earth's surface is defined by two co-ordinates; its longitude and latitude.
Longitude

A point's longitude is measured east or west along the equator. Longitude ranges from 0° to 180° East and 0° to ° West. Lines of constant longitude are known as meridians; they are all great circles. The figure to the right shows several meridians.
There is no obvious zero point for longitude. In practise, a single meridian is chosen to represent zero longitude. Since UK astronomers and clockmakers were instrumental in the development of techniques to measure longitude, the Prime Meridian (as it is known) passes through Greenwich.

Latitude

The latitude of an object is the angular distance north or south of the equator. Lines of constant latitude run parallel to the equator. They are called parallels of latitude. The figure to the right shows several parallels of latitude. Latitude goes from 0° at the equator to +90° N at the North Pole or -90° S at the South Pole.

**Units of angle**

The coordinates in spherical geometry are angles. We can choose to represent these angles in a number of different ways. Degrees are probably the most familiar to you, but degrees can be written as decimals, or in sexagesimal notation. In sexagesimal notation, each degree can be broken into 60 minutes of arc, or arcminutes ('). Each minute in turn can be divided into sixty arcseconds ("). For more accuracy, fractions of seconds can be quoted using a decimal point.

For example, the location of the Robotic Observatory for Sheffield Astronomy (ROSA) is 53°22’50” N, 1°29’9” W. That can also written in decimal degrees as 53.3806° N, 1.486° W. To convert between decimal and sexagesimal notation, divide the minutes by 60, the seconds by 3600 and add the degrees, minutes and seconds together. The calculator below can do this conversion for you

Because the Earth rotates, it is also possible to express longitude in units of time. The Earth rotates by 360° in about 24 hours. Hence, the Earth rotates 15° of longitude in 1 hour, 1° of longitude in 4 minutes, 1´ of longitude in 4 seconds and 1" of longitude in 1/15 second. The longitude of ROSA can therefore also be written in hours, minutes and seconds as 1°29’9” = 0h5m56.6s.

It is a bit confusing that both time and sexagesimal degrees use the terms minutes and seconds! In this course, I shall always refer to arcminutes and arcseconds when talking about sexagesimal degrees.

**The Celestial Sphere**
The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of infinite radius centered on the Earth, on which all celestial bodies are assumed to be projected. This Earth-centered Universe is, of course, not an accurate model of the real Universe, but it turns out to be an extremely useful tool for understanding the relative positions of celestial objects, and their apparent motions through the sky. It is the most important concept in this course; so make sure you understand it well!

The celestial sphere is shown in the figure below. The celestial sphere is fixed. However, the Earth rotates inside the sphere, and so, from our point of view, the celestial sphere appears to rotate. The Earth rotates towards the east (counter-clockwise from a perspective looking down onto the north pole). So an observer on Earth appears to see the celestial sphere rotate towards the west (or clockwise, looking towards the north pole).

*Celestial Co-ordinates*

This apparent rotation of the celestial sphere presents us with an obvious co-ordinate system to locate objects upon it. The extensions of the north pole and south pole of the Earth intersect with the north celestial pole and the south celestial pole, respectively, and the projection of the Earth's equator on the celestial sphere defines the celestial equator. The celestial sphere can then be divided up into a grid in a similar manner to the way in which the Earth is divided up into a grid of latitude and longitude, as shown in the figure to the right (bottom of page on mobiles).

*Declination*

Declination (DEC, or δ) is analogous to latitude on the Earth's surface. It is measured from the celestial equator, and extends from 0° at the celestial equator to +90° at the north celestial pole and from 0° at celestial equator to -90° at the south celestial pole. Declination is shown in the figure by the red line.

*Right Ascension*

Right Ascension (RA, or α) is analogous to longitude on the Earth's surface. It is measured around the celestial equator. RA is measured in hours, and increases to the east. Since the Earth rotates once in roughly 24 hours, RA extends from 0h to 24h. Much as we had to choice an (arbitrary) zero point for longitude, we also need a zero point for right ascension. This zero point is known as the first point of Aries. We'll learn more about why it was chosen when we look at how the Sun moves on the celestial sphere. RA is shown in the figure with the blue line.


**The Horizontal System**


What does the celestial sphere look like when observed from a position on the Earth's surface?

We ignore any landscape around the observer, so the observer has the impression of being on a flat plane and at the centre of a vast hemisphere across which the celestial bodies move. On all sides, the plane stretches out to meet the base of this celestial hemisphere at the horizon. Directly above the observer's head is the zenith (and directly below his feet is the nadir). Directions around the horizon are labelled with the familiar cardinal points, N, S, E and W. Finally, the line passing through the zenith and the south point on the horizon is known as the observer's meridian.


It is useful to define coordinates which specify the position of the star from the point of view of the observer. These are altitude and azimuth.

*Azimuth*

Azimuth is measured around the horizon. Azimuth ranges from 0 to 360°. North is at 0° and azimuth increases to the east, so east is 90°, south 180° and west 270°. Stars with the same azimuth lie on a vertical circle running from the zenith down to the horizon. This vertical circle is a great circle. Azimuth is marked in red on the figure to the right.

*Altitude*

A star's altitude measures how high it appears in the sky. It is measured along the vertical circle defined earlier, and increases from 0° at the horizon to 90° at the zenith. Since a star can be below the horizon, altitude ranges from -90° to 90°.

*The celestial sphere in the sky*

We need to know where the features of the celestial sphere appear from the point of view of the observer.

The diagram to the right shows an observers view of the celestial sphere. Positional astronomy is often easy if you know what diagram to draw; the diagram to the right is the most important one in the whole course; it allows you to draw the celestial sphere from any point on the Earth's Surface. It is called the horizon diagram.

Because the radius of the celestial hemisphere is infinite compared with the radius of the Earth, the directions of the north celestial pole and the celestial equator as viewed by the observer are indistinguishable from their real directions (which are defined relative to the centre of the Earth.)

Now we can see how the celestial sphere appears from any given latitude, Φ. Assuming our observer is in the northern hemisphere, as shown in the figure, the north celestial pole appears in the sky at an altitude equal to Φ, and towards the north. The celestial equator is located at an altitude of 90-Φ, and towards the south. At the north and south poles, the celestial equator lies along the horizon. (img=doc/the-horizontal-system.png)

**Daily Motion of the Stars**

*Rotation of the Sky*

The celestial sphere itself is fixed. But, because the Earth rotates, from our point of view the celestial sphere appears to rotate. The Earth rotates, roughly once per day, towards the east. This means the celestial sphere appears to rotate, roughly once per day towards the west. The stars, of course, rotate about an axis through the north and south celestial poles. It follows then that the stars appear to rotate around the celestial poles, and move from east to west.

From our previous discussion of how the celestial sphere appears in horizon co-ordinates, we know that an northern hemisphere observer sees the north celestial pole at an altitude given by their latitude, Φ. The diagram below then illustrates the paths of some stars over the course of a night, for a northern hemisphere observer.
Gemini star trails

The stars appear to revolve from east to west about the celestial poles on circular paths parallel to the celestial equator once per day. Some stars (like the red star above) never set and remain visible at night all year. These are called circumpolar stars. A circumpolar star at its maximum altitude above the horizon is said to be at its upper culmination. Similarly, a circumpolar star at its minimum altitude above the horizon is said to be at its lower culmination. Stars further from the pole rise, attain a maximum altitude above the horizon (when they are said to transit) and then set below the horizon (e.g. the yellow star above). These stars, unsurprisingly, are called rise/set stars. Which stars are circumpolar depends on the latitude of the observer; stars within an angle Φ of the north celestial pole are circumpolar for an observer at northern-hemisphere latitude Φ. From the diagram, and what you know about celestial co-ordinates, we can see that stars with a declination greater than 90-Φ are circumpolar. Similarly, stars within an angle Φ of the south celestial pole never rise for our northern hemisphere observer, like the blue star in the diagram above. (img=doc/motion-of-stars.png)


**Transit Altitude**

When is a star highest in the sky? Looking at the diagram on the right, it is clear that a star reaches its highest point in the sky when it crosses the observer's meridian, the line which passes through the zenith and the south point on the horizon.

As we discussed previously, for stars which rise and set, the star is said to transit when it crosses this line. Thus, the highest point a star reaches in the sky is known as it's transit altitude. The diagram below shows how to calculate the transit altitude for a star of declination δ, for an observer at latitude Φ.
diurnal motion

As shown here, the north celestial pole lies at an altitude of Φ above the horizon, and the celestial equator is 90° away. At it's highest point, the celestial equator attains an altitude of 90-Φ, as shown above. The declination of the star is measured from the celestial equator, and so the transit altitude of our star is given by 90-Φ+δ. The star will be due south when it transits. What about a star in the direction given by the red arrow? For this star, the formula 90-Φ+δ yields an altitude of more than 90°, but as we have seen, altitude ranges from 0° to 90°. Instead, we must use the formula 180-(90-Φ+δ), as shown in the diagram below. This star will be due north when it transits.

**Motion of the Sun**
In the last session, we looked at the idea of the celestial sphere, and how the Earth's rotation means that stars appear to follow nightly paths on the celestial sphere. Our model of the celestial sphere is geocentric, meaning that the Earth is taken to be at the centre of the sphere. Of course, in reality the Earth orbits around the Sun. The Earth's orbit around the Sun will cause the apparent position of the Sun to move around the celestial sphere over the course of a year. In this session, we'll look at that in detail, and examine the consequences for the observability of stars.
The figures above show the motion of the Earth around the Sun. Obviously, they are not to scale! The effect of the Earth's motion is to make the Sun appear to be on one side of the celestial sphere in December, and on the opposite side in June. This means that, over the course of a year, the Earth's orbit around the Sun means that the Sun's position of the celestial sphere changes slowly.

What does this look like over the course of a single night? Over one night, the Earth has moved a small amount around its orbit, and so it is a reasonable approximation to treat the Sun as a fixed point on the celestial sphere. Therefore over a single night, we can say that the Sun moves through the sky like any other star on the celestial sphere.

Generally speaking, we can only see stars once the Sun has set. It follows that the stars which are visible at any time of year are those which are opposite the Sun. As a result, the night sky in December looks very different to the night sky in June. As astronomers, we need to make detailed calculations to work out if a given star is visible at a certain type of year. To do that, we need to look in more detail at the path the Sun follows on the celestial sphere over the course of a year. (img = doc/motion-of-the-sun-1.png & motion-of-the-sun-2.png)

**Sidereal vs Synodic Days**

*Sidereal Day*
The word sidereal comes from the latin for "star". A sidereal day is the time taken for the stars to appear in the same place in the night sky. This corresponds to one full rotation of the Earth (from 1-2 in the diagram on the right). A sidereal day is 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds long. (img doc/sidereal.png)

*Synodic Day*

The word synodic derives from the Greek word for meeting or assembly. A synodic, or solar day is the amount of time taken for the Sun to return to the observer's meridian. From the diagram above, we see that the Earth has to rotate a little more than 360° for the Sun to appear in the same place in the sky. A solar day is, on average, 24 hours long. Because the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical, the length of any given solar day can be slightly different to 24 hours. 


**The Ecliptic**

To fully understand the consequences of the Sun's motion around the celestial sphere, we need to know how to predict it's position on the sphere at any time of year. The path that the Sun follows round the celestial sphere is known as the ecliptic. The Sun always lies in the plane of the Earth's orbit, and so the intersection of this plane with the celestial sphere defines the ecliptic.

The Earth's spin axis is inclined with respect to its orbit. This misalignment of spin axis and orbit is called the axial tilt, or obliquity, ε. The amount of obliquity is currently 23° 27'. Since the poles of the celestial sphere are aligned with the spin axis of the Earth, the plane of Earth's orbit traces an inclined circle on the celestial sphere; this is the ecliptic. The Sun lies on the ecliptic at all times, and traces a path around it over the course of one year (365.242 mean solar days), as shown below. 

The ecliptic crosses the celestial equator at two points, located in the constellations of Aries and Libra. As a result, twice a year the Sun has a declination of zero. The first point of aries, ♈, is defined as the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north. This occurs roughly around March 20th, the spring equinox, sometimes called the vernal equinox. The second date when the Sun has declination of zero is when it crosses the celestial equator from north to south, know as the autumnal equinox, which occurs around September 22nd. Since the Sun has a declination of zero on the dates of equinox, those dates see 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night almost everywhere on the Earth (use the coordinate system comparison applet at University of Nebraska to see this for yourself). One more point before moving on. In the last session, we discussed the celestial co-ordinate system, and said that we had to make a choice for the location of zero right ascension. A natural choice for this point is where the Sun crosses the celestial equator, which is why the first point of Aries defines zero right ascension. 
(img = doc/the-ecliptic.png)


**Predicting the Sun's RA and Dec**

We can use the Sun's motion around the ecliptic to calculate the right ascension (RA), and declination (dec) of the Sun on any given day. Around March 20th, the Sun is at the first point of Aries and has zero dec, and zero RA. Since it is moving from south to north at this point, the dec of the Sun will increase with time. The dec of the Sun reaches a maximum of +ε at the summer solstice, and a minimum of -ε at the winter solstice. What happens to the Sun's right ascension? Imagine the Sun at noon on the vernal equinox. The Sun is on the observer's meridian. One sidereal day later, all the stars are in the same position. However, since the sidereal day is shorter than the solar day, the Sun has not yet reached the meridian; it is slightly to the east. Since RA increases to the east, it follows that the Sun's RA has increased. Over the course of a year the Sun must move through 24h of RA to return to the same place, so the Sun's RA increases by roughly 2 hours a month. The applet below summarises the motion of the Sun in RA and dec, over the course of a year. 


**Advanced celestial Coords**
 We have previously discussed the equatorial co-ordinate system (RA and Dec). One of the great advantages of the equatorial system is that the RA and Dec of a star do not change with time, at least over short timescales. This makes the equatorial co-ordinate system excellent for keeping star catalogues.

Over longer timescales however, the RA and Dec of a star does change, due to a combination of effects. We'll look at them in more detail here.

*Precession*

The Earth's spin axis is not fixed in space, but instead precesses slowly due to the gravitational pulls of the Sun and Moon on the non-spherical Earth. The phenomenon is completely analogous to the precession of a child's spinning top. The Earth's precession period is 25,770 years and precession causes the north celestial pole (NCP) to make a slow circle around the heavens. Although Polaris is currently less than 1° away from the NCP, in 13,000 years it will be nearly 47° away. The same effect causes the celestial equator to move. As a result, the first point of Aries is moving westwards along the ecliptic by around 50"/year. In fact, the first point of Aries is currently in the constellation of Pisces! This effect is known as precession of the equinoxes. It means that the RA and Dec of stars are slowly changing in time.

To get around this, star catalogues specify the equinox (or reference date) when listing the RA and Dec of a star. For an example, and equinox of 2000.0, tells you that the RA and Dec of a star are given relative to the position of the NCP and first point of Aries at noon in Greenwich on January 1st 2000. Although precession is a slow phenomenon, we can measure the positions of stars to such accuracy that all positional measurements must be corrected for precession. Approximate expressions for the changes in the RA (α) and Dec (δ) since equinox 2000.0 are

Δα = M + N sinα tanδ
Δδ = N cosα

where M and N are given by

M = 1°.2812323 T + 0°.0003879 T2 + 0°.0000101 T3
N = 0°.5567530 T - 0°.0001185 T2 + 0°.0000116 T3

and T is defined as

T = (t-2000.0)/100

where t is the current date, specified in fractions of a year.

*Proper Motion*

Precession will change the RA and Dec of a star even it is not moving through space. However, stars do indeed move, and we cannot neglect stellar motion over moderate timescales. A star's motion through space is called its proper motion, and given the symbol μ. For a star with significant proper motion we must specify, in addition to the RA, Dec and equinox, the star's proper motion, and when the position was measured (known as the epoch). If no epoch is given, it is assumed to be the same as the equinox for an entry. The figure below shows a typical set of entries in a star catalogue.

*Beyond Earth-defined coordinates (optional)*

The equatorial co-ordinate system, as discussed so far, relies on us knowing where on the sky the NCP and first point of Aries actually are at any given time. As long as these are defined by the rotation axis of the Earth, we will be reliant on our models of the Earth's rotation and precession to know where the NCP actually is, at any given time.

Therefore, in modern astronomy, we have defined a set of reference objects, which have set right ascensions and declinations. These reference objects and their co-ordinates define the celestial co-ordinate system. This co-ordinate system is called the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS), and is defined by the positions of a specific set of extragalactic objects, which are assumed to have no proper motions. Modern positions are usually quoted in the ICRS system, but the ICRS axes are consistent to better than 0.1 arcseconds with the equinox of 2000.0 defined by the dynamics of the Earth. 


**Sidereal Time**

*Hour Angle*

The hour angle of a star is a measure of it's position relative to the observer's meridian. A star on the observer's meridian has an hour angle of zero, and it increases towards the west. Since stars move from east to west, a star's hour angle increases with time. Strictly defined, the hour angle is the angle between the observer's meridian and the meridian of RA which passes through the star. Hour angle (or HA) runs from -12 to 12h. Stars with negative hour angles are yet to transit the meridian.

*Sidereal Time*

Since a star's HA increases with time, it follows that hour angle can be used as a definition of time. In fact, astronomers use the hour angle of the first point of Aries, HA♈, as a measure of time known as sidereal time. Since the location of the observer's meridian is dependent on the longitude of the observer, the hour angle of the first point of Aries is known as the local sidereal time:

LST = HA♈

and is zero when the first point of Aries passes the observer's meridian.
The figure on the right shows the relationship between LST, HA and RA. The meridian which passes through the first point of Aries is drawn in yellow and labelled 0h RA.

RA is measured eastwards from this point, and the star's RA is shown in white. HA is measured westwards from the observer's meridian and the star's HA is shown in yellow. Remembering that the local sidereal time is equal to the hour angle of the first point of Aries, it is clear from the figure that

LST = HAx + RAx,

where HAx and RAx are the hour angle and right ascension of the star, respectively. This relationship holds for any celestial object. Since the hour angle of an object is zero when an object crosses the observer's meridian, it follows that a star transits when the local sidereal time is equal to its right ascension. This is a very useful relationship!

*Sidereal Time Explorer*

Click to start applet
The image to the right will launch another of the University of Nebraska's applets, which allows you to explore the relationship between hour angle, right ascension and sidereal time.

**Solar Time**

Using sidereal time to run your daily affairs would be pretty inconvenient. We saw that the relationship

LST = HAx + RAx

holds for any celestial object, including the Sun. So the local sidereal time is also given by

LST = HA☉ + RA☉,

where HA☉ and RA☉ are the hour angle and right ascension of the Sun. But of course, the Sun moves around the ecliptic, so RA☉ changes through the year. If we had to go to work every day at the same local sidereal time, sometimes this would be in the day, and sometimes at night!

It's hardly surprising then, that we use solar time to govern civil timekeeping. The solar time is related to the hour angle of the sun, so that the Sun is always near the observer's meridian at noon. By convention, local noon is at 12:00, so that the solar time is given by

ST = HA☉ + 12h.

The 12 hour correction ensures that the solar time is always 12:00 when the Sun is on the meridian.

In reality, things are a little more complicated than described above, as the Earth's orbit is elliptical, which means that the length of the solar day varies throughout the year. This means that the Sun might be up to 15 minutes in front or behind the meridian at local noon. We won't go into that in this course, but it is discussed in more detail in Vik Dhillon's excellent notes from the discontinued PHY105.

*Universal Time*

The hour angle of the Sun depends on the observer's longitude and so solar time is different for observers at different longitudes. It is convenient to define a reference longitude to use for setting clocks by. This reference point is the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, the same point used to define the zero of the longitude scale. We can then define Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Universal Time (UT), with reference to the hour angle of the Sun for an observer at Greenwich (HA☉,G) as

UT = GMT = HA☉,G + 12h.

*Sidereal Time & Solar Time*

Quite often we will want to convert between sidereal time and solar time (either local or GMT). For example, we may wish to know if a certain star transits during the day or not. This is quite easy, given the relationships presented here, provided one knows the right ascension of the Sun on any given day. You can roughly calculate the Sun's right ascension from it's motion around the ecliptic, or (if you want a precise value), use the online calculator from the US Department of Energy.

**HA revisited**
We should look at hour angle in more detail, since an incomplete understanding of hour angle often causes problems with the material in this session. Remember that hour angle is measured as the time since an object has passed the observer's meridian. Local Sidereal Time is defined as the hour angle of the first point of Aries (0h RA), so if we set the LST in the explorer below to 00:00, the HA of the first point of Aries is 0, and the 0h RA circle lies on the observer's meridian.

One thing is very important to note. Click on the "show hour angle arc" tickbox in the explorer. Note that the hour angle is the angle between the observer's meridian and the **line of constant RA which passes through the star**. Try and remember this fact! 


**Spherical Triangles**

We discussed in the first session that geometry on the surface of a sphere differs from geometry on a plane. Of particular importance is the difference in trigonometry. Just as you can define a triangle on a planar surface, you can define a triangle on the surface of a sphere.

A planar triangle is the shape which connects three points by the shortest route (along straight lines). In the same way, a spherical triangle connects three points by the shortest route. Since we are now working on the surface of a sphere, the sides of a spherical triangle are no longer straight lines, but follow great circles, which we defined in the first session.

The complete definition of a spherical triangle is that it must fulfil all of the following conditions:

• each side is a part of a great circle,
• any two sides together are longer than the third side,
• each angle is less than 180°,
• the sum of the three angles is greater than 180°.

You can immediately see that many of the rules you know for planar triangles no longer apply to spherical triangles. Consider the spherical triangle shown in the figure to the right. It connects the points PAB. To follow the sides of this triangle you would start at the north pole, and travel south to the equator. There you would turn left by 90° and walk a quarter of the way around the equator. At that point you'd turn left through 90° again and walk back to the pole. To get back to the way you were originally facing you'd have to turn left through 90° again. The sum of the three angles in the spherical triangle PAB is 270°! 
(img = doc/spherical-triangle.png)

**Spherical Trigonometry**

To make calculations with spherical triangles, we need to know the laws of spherical trigonometry, the direct analogue of the planar trigonometry you know and love. The figure below defines terminology which will be useful. A spherical triangle is formed from arcs along three great circles (dotted lines). The arc lengths are denoted by a,b,c and the vertex angles by A,B,C. The labels are chosen so that the arc 'c' is opposite vertex 'C'. (img=doc/spherical-triangle.png)

One thing to note: the arc lengths are measured as angles. For example, the distance from the north pole to the equator along a meridian can be written as 10,006 km, or as 90°, or as π/2 radians. The latter two are more useful, as they don't depend upon the radius of the sphere; for that reason it makes sense to use angles to measure both arc lengths and vertex angles of spherical triangles.

All of the problems in this section of the course can be solved with the definition of a spherical triangle, a bit of thought, and two simple rules. The difficult part of this is choosing which spherical triangle will help you with the problems. Once that's done, the two rules below will help you work out the quantity of interest.

*The sine rule*

	sin a   sin b   sin c
	----  = ----- = -----
	sin A	sin B   sin C

*The cosine rule*

	cos a = cos b * cos c + sin b * sin c * cos A

If you want to see how to derive these rules, there is a derivation in pages 52-54 of Astronomy: Principles and Practice by A. E. Roy and D. Clarke. A copy of this book is in the astro lab, and the main library also has copies.
We have to be a little careful about how the vertex angles are defined. Strictly, they are defined so the vertex angle B is the angle between the tangents between the two great circle arcs that make up point B, as shown in the diagram below. 
(img=doc/spherical-trigo.png)

*Conversion between Celestial Co-ordinates and Horizontal Co-ordinates*

To reach this point has been the goal of the whole course so far. We now show how to calculate the position of any celestial object in the night sky. What we are really after is to be able to calculate the solar time an object is at a certain altitude and azimuth. Of course, if we know the right ascension and hour angle of an object, we can work out the local sideral time, and from that the solar time and UT. Therefore, we will start by calculating the altitude and hour angle of a celestial object with right ascension α and declination δ.

We said earlier that the difficulty is knowing which spherical triangle to draw. In the figure below I have solved that problem for you. See if you can work out what the angles and arc lengths labelled with question marks should be, then hover your mouse over the image to see if you're right. (img=doc/coordinate-conversion.png)


**Positional Calculations**

Using the correctly labelled spherical triangle shown below, we can make detailed calculations of the position of a star, using the spherical trigonometry rules we have learnt.(img=doc/positional-calculations.png)


We can calculate the altitude and azimuth of the star shown above, by applying the cosine rule.

	cos a = cos b * cos c + sin b * sin c * cos A

Applying the cosine rule to the triangle above we get two equations:
	
	1	cos(90-alt) = cos(90-Φ) cos(90-δ) + sin(90-Φ) sin(90-δ) cos HA
	2 	cos(90-δ) = cos(90-Φ) cos(90-alt) + sin(90-Φ) sin(90-alt) cos(360-Az)
	
These can be simplified enormously using the trigonometric identities

    cos(360-x) = cos 360 cos x + sin 360 sin x = cos x
    cos(90-x) = cos 90 cos x + sin 90 sin x = sin x
    sin(90-x) = sin 90 cos x - cos 90 sin x = cos x

Applying these identities yields
	
	1	sin alt = sin Φ sin δ + cos Φ cos δ cos HA
	2	sin δ = sin Φ sin alt + cos Φ cos alt cos Az
	
These equations, together with the material you have learnt in the previous lectures, are all you need to predict the position of a celestial object from any point on Earth, at any time of day or year. The problems in this session and the next session will give you plenty of practise doing just that. There is one special case which is worth mentioning; the rise and set times of stars. 


**Rise/Set Times**
	
	1	sin alt = sin Φ sin δ + cos Φ cos δ cos HA
	2	sin δ = sin Φ sin alt + cos Φ cos alt cos Az
	
Using the equations above, we can work out a simple formula for the hour angle of an object when it rises or sets. When an object rises or sets, it's altitude is 0°. Substituting that into equation 1, we find

	sin 0 = 0 = sin Φ sin δ + cos Φ cos δ cos HA

or

	cos HA = - sin δ sin Φ / cos δ cos Φ

which we re-write

	cos HA = - tan δ tan Φ

*A worked example*

From Sheffield, we will calculate what time the Sun rises and sets on the Winter Solstice. The Sun's declination on this date is -23.45° and the latitude of Sheffield is roughly 53°. Therefore,

cos HA = - tan (-23.45) tan (53) = 0.57

Which gives an HA at sunset of 55°, or 24*55/360 = 3.7 hours = 3 hours 40 minutes. Since the Sun is on the observer's meridian at 12:00 (noon), the time of sunset is 3 hours and 40 minutes after that, or 15:40.

Since sunrise-noon takes the same amount of time as sunset-noon, sunrise is 3 hours 40 minutes before noon, or at 8:20. On the Winter Solstice there is 7 hours and 20 minutes of sunshine, at most.

*Ambiguity*

This worked example illustrates one very important point. There are two possible hour angles when a star has an altitude of zero. There are two possible azimuths when a star has a given altitude. The equations in these notes will only give you one of these hour angles or azimuth. You have to use your reason to see if it is the rising or setting hour angle and azimuth and use symmetry to find the answer you need.

For example, the calculation above gave us the setting hour angle. We used symmetry to work out the rising hour angle.
